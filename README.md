…to reveal a random letter and its position 🔍
⚠️ BUT using a hint costs 1 life 💀

📌 Rules

🎯 Goal: Guess the secret word before you run out of lives.
❤️ Lives: You start with the same number of lives as the word has letters.
💡 Hints: Each hint reveals:

A random letter 🔤

Its position in the word 📍
…and costs 1 life.

❌ Wrong guesses don’t take a life (so keep trying!) 😄
☠️ If your lives hit 0, it’s game over.
